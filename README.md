haven't deployed to github pages yet

just main branch for now

done with nav bar i think
(besides sticky)

cool ideas

- journal page (or could be called projects or whatever) like https://www.meiwensee.com/journal/vivian-chan
- could have a section for film and then for regular
  (like black and white, color)
  - or could also have a section for portraits, landscapes, ....
  - either in the same page dif categories, or dif pages in the nav bar, or under a dropdown (could do a dropdown that links to the anchors if all on one page and pressing the main dropdown would bring u to all)
- maybe some sort of word cloud on the front page?
- that defintion and phonetic spelling here is cool (https://www.meiwensee.com/)
- i like the idea of on the contact page "let's work together" and a list of all the kinds of things you do and then maybe a link to a google form or to your socials/contacts (ex at bottom here: https://www.meiwensee.com/journal)
- the custom modal here with prev/next is cool https://www.marvinlei.com/portrait/iyn2ob7fiilukvyqq5k0u1h9ugfgwr

for prev/next buttons

- make them light up on hover like the X close button

for nav bar

- need to fix the colors for the small screen nav cause now they are backwards and disappear
