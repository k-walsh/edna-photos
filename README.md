haven't deployed to github pages yet

just main branch for now

left off on nav stuff, need to ...

- see how to make the x and logo be up top, then press on x to move to showing the other hamburger instead of copy and pastign the code like i have now
- kind of like make it so the logo and hamburger are aligned originally, when ham pressed, the top logo disappears and the links appear in the middle and fullscreen, then press x and they disappear
- but all with nice transitions innstead of completely different components
